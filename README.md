Qogir-dark Kvantum theme with colors more closely matching the GTK counterpart

The qogir-dark Kvantum theme has *way* too muted text colors in KDE, which is not the correct colorset when compared to the GTK theme (looking at gtk.css). All this does is move gtk.css text colors into the Kvantum's theme.
